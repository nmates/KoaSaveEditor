Savegames seem to start with the following 4 bytes
00000000  c4 db d8 00

At offset +0x04, there's some internal offset that seems 32-bit based
e.g. 0a 85 00 00

At offset +0x08, there's a byte that seems to always be 00
- Not sure if previous offset is really 5 bytes long. 

At offset +0x9 .. 0x10 (64 bits), looks like a timestamp (seems 64 bit)

 - Delta = (0x97A6) 38822, seems like gameplay time in MS.
save0 had this very high. Autosave(?)

Offset 0x0D, 32-bit int seems to be always 0. Could be a net 8 byte
time played in ms. Need a savegame past 38 days to determine

Offset 0x11 start of game header info. These are 'Pascal' strings
(prefixed by length, 32 bit), not 0-terminated 'C' strings. Can't tell
if this is UTF-7/UTF-8/etc, but in English, these appear as ascii.
